  \section*{Abstract}
   
  Humanoid robots are made as mirror to the humans. Consequently, the humanoid motion is also expected to be real as 
  human and it is natural to use human motion as an input to generate humanoid motion like a child learning from recogniting
  an action and imitating. This process in robots is called motion imitation and there are several challenges posed 
  due to kinematics and dynamics of the robot over the past decades. Although the work on the kinematic challenges is 
  actively improving and notably better than dynamics, it allows the robot only to move and imitate slow actions. 
  For the fast paced motions, \textit{momentum} gets build up and needs dynamics to be taken into account. Due to the 
  differences in redundancy between humanoid robots and humans, real-time imitation in humanoid robots while keeping 
  balance and support changes is still an interesting problem that need to be addressed.

  ~
  
  On this research, motion retargetting or the motion imitation based on dynamic balance and support with dynamic filtering 
  is planned to be implemented on humanoid robot \textit{NAO v5}, from Aldebaran Robotics. The imitation will be carried out 
  online using marker-based motion capture suit from \textit{Xsens}, specifically \textit{Xsens MVN Analyze} system.
  
  ~
  
  The captured motion from the inertial suit will be preprocessed for its representation in operational space and will be 
  scaled to the robot's dimensions. From this scaled motion, for this thesis, a set of actions are taken and will be addressed
  for the balance problem in \textit{NAO} robot. The joint, CoM and the ZMP data of the human actor will be mapped to the robot
  using the scaling function directly. To ensure the stability and to keep up the speed with the human actor, an additional 
  dynamic filter and multi-inverted pendulum based posture control will be implemented.
